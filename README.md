# Work Day Planner

## Description

This is a simple workday planner that allows you to see what your day has in store. You can see the current hour in light blue. Future hours are in different shades of green depending on the presense of a meeting. Past hours show in grey. You can add, edit, or delete meetings in the future by clicking the appropriate icon.
